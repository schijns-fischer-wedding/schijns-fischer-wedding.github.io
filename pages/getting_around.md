<h2>Getting Around</h2>
  
<h3>Public transport</h3> 
  
<p>
  A general note is that public transport and bikes are the go-to method for 
  getting around in all Dutch cities, including Utrecht. 
  For most purposes public transport (OV) is a great option. 
</p>
  

  <h4>OV card</h4>
<p>
  If you plan to make use of the public transport system for more than a day, we
  recommend you to pick up an anonymous 
  <a href="https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/information/public-transport/ov-chip-card-5.htm">ov card</a>. 
  You should be able to easily
  obtain one at Schiphol. You can then put money on the OV card and travel as
  much as you'd like. Note that travel is free for kids under the age of 4.  
</p>
  
  <h4>Apps</h4>
<p>
  Google maps works, but we also recommend installing the NS app. 
  The NS is the principal railway operator, but their app also recommends 
  routes by busses and trams. 
</p>

<h4>Schiphol to Utrecht</h4>
<p>
  If you intend to use public transport purely to get to Utrecht Centraal, you
  could also buy a single-trip ticket at the NS vending machines.
</p>

<h4>Bikes</h4>
<p>
  Some hotels may offer bike rentals, but there are many options out there.
  It is a great option if you'd like to explore the city as a local. For 
  longer distances we recommend using an electric bike. Be careful with those 
  though, they go fast.
</p>

<h3>Taxis</h3>
<p>
  Uber is available, but they are not as common as in big cities in the US.
  <br>
  An example of a traditional taxi is <a href="https://utc.nl/">UTC</a>: +31 030 777777
</p>

<h3>Car rentals</h3>
<p>
Cars can be rented from Schiphol Airport. Check with your hotel whether you can
park with them, this is not a given.
