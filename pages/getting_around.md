<h2>Getting Around</h2>
<p>
  A general note is that public transport and bikes are the go to method for getting around in Dutch cities, including Utrecht. 
  For most purposes you should be able to get around using public transport. 
</p>
  
<h3>Public transport</p> 
<h4>OV card</h4>
<p>
  If you plan to make use of the public transport system for more than a day, we recommend you to pick up an anonymous OV card. 
  You should be able to easily obtain one at Schiphol. 
  You can then put money on the OV card and travel as much as you'd like. 
  Note that for kids under tha age of 4 travel is free.

<h4>Schiphol to Utrecht</h4> 
<p>
  If you intend to use public transport purely to get to Utrecht Centraal, you could also buy a single-trip ticket at the NS vending machines. </p> 

<h4>Bikes</h4>  
<p>
  Some hotels may offer bike rentals, if not, there are many options out there. 
  It is great if you'd like to explore. For longer distances, >10 km we recommend using an electric bike. 
  Be careful with those though, they go fast.  
</p>
  
<h3>Taxis</h3>
<p>
Uber is available, but they are not as common as in big cities in the US.
