  <h2>For Those Travelling Long Distances</h2>
  <p>
    We have a number of guests traveling from the United States and countries
    other than the Netherlands. If this is you, we are trying to arrange to
    spend some time with you in the days before or after the wedding on May 19.
    If we have not already put something on our calendars, please get in touch
    so we can make plans.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Schedule | 19 May 2023</h2>

  <h3>Ceremony | 16.00</h3>

  <p>
    Utrecht City Hall, Grote Zaal (big hall)
    <br>
    Stadhuisbrug 1, 3511 JK Utrecht
  </p>

  <p>
    Please arrive at least 15 minutes before the start of the ceremony in
    order to find your seat. Parking here can be tough, see <a href="https://schijns-fischer-wedding.github.io/pages/getting_around.html">getting around</a> for details on how to use public transport. 
  </p>

  <h3>Reception | 17.00</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.wilhelminapark.nl/">Wilhelminapark</a>
    <br>
    Wilhelminapark 65, 3581 NP Utrecht
  </p>

  <p>
    Dinner and reception will be at the same location, the restaurant Wilhelminapark. 
    The restaurant has the same name as the park it is located in, this can be a little 
    confusing. If you are coming by car, set your navigation to Koningslaan 115 in 
    Utrecht. With this adress you drive to the side of the park where most parking is available.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the ceremony location, it is a 20 min walk or a 5 min bike ride. 
    If you plan to use public
    transportation, we recommend bus 8 from Neude to Burg. Reigerstraat. Let us
    know if you would like a buddy, we will find a local to travel with you. The
    location has parking options available nearby. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We will have a first toast at the reception, where drinks and bites will be served. 
    We also hope to have some pictures with our guests at this time. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Dinner | 19.00</h3>
  
  <p>
    Around 19.00 we will start our dinner at restaurant Wilhelminapark. 
    If the weather allows it, we will sit outside. 
    We will have a vegetable-heavy dinner, with some fish options. Be sure in the RSVP to
    indicate whether you would like the fish, otherwise we will assume you prefer the 
    vegetarian option.
