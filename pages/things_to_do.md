# Things to Do

### Food & Drink  
**[O'pannuozo](http://www.o-panuozzo.nl/)**  
  Classic neapolitan pizzas.  
  This, in combination with a glass of wine at Talud9, is Marijne's favorite date-night!  

**[Talud 9](https://www.talud9.nl/)**  
  Great for coffee and cake in the afternoon, even better for wine in the evening. 
  
**[30 ML](https://30ml.nl/)**  
  Great brunch place (as recommended by Anne & Daan)  
  On lunch breaks, Marijne goes here to pick up a bag of beans.  
  
**[Broodje Mario](https://broodjemario.nl/)**  
  Sandwiches to go, classic Utrecht experience. No Utrecht experience is complete without a Broodje Mario. Note, there is no seating and they only accept cash.  

**[Hop & Stork](https://hopenstork.com/)**  
  Fantastic coffee and chocolate

**Kasteel de Haar**  
  This is a [beautiful castle](https://www.kasteeldehaar.nl/), where once a year a Renaissance fair is organized; [Elfia](https://www.instagram.com/kingdomofelfia/?hl=en). One could argue that Elfia 2019 was the moment Savannah and Marijne's relationship was truly solidified. A historic location!  

**Woerden**  
  If you would like to visit [Woerden](https://www.beleefwoerden.com/nl), Marijne's hometown, we recommend going on a sunny Saturday.
