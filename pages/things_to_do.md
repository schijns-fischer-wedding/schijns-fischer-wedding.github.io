# Things to Do

### Food & Drink  
**O'pannuozo**  
  Classic neapolitan pizzas.  
  This, in combination with a glass of wine at Talud9, is Marijne's favorite date-night!  

**Talud 9**  
  Great for coffee and cake in the afternoon, even better for wine in the evening  

**sabra**  
  We had dinner with Gail and Guus here.  
  
**30 ML**  
  Great brunch place (as recommended by Anne & Daan)  
  We tend to get our coffee here   
  
**broodje Mario**  
  Sandwiches to go, classic Utrecht experience  

**Hop & Stork**  
  Fantastic coffee and chocolate

### Day outings  
**dagje kasteel de Haar**  
  This is a beautiful castle, where once a year a Renaissance fair is organized; Elfia. One could argue that Elfia 2019 was the moment Savannah and Marijne's relationship was truly solidified. A historic location!  

**dagje Woerden**  
  If you would like to visti Woerden, Marijne's hometown, we recommend going on a sunny Saturday. You will not find a more pitoresque dutch town, it even has a windmill you can visit!
