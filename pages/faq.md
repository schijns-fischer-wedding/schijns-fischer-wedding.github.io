   <h2>FAQ</h2>
 
<h3>What language are we speaking?</h3>
<p>
  Our Dutch guests understand English, but some may feel more comfortable expressing themselves in Dutch.  
  We encourage people to do speeches in whichever language they prefer, 
  and to consider bringing a printed version or send us an electronic version we can distribute in both languages.  
</p>
  
<h3>What is a <em>stukje</em>? Can I do one?</h3> 
<p>
  A <em>stukje</em> is a dutch interpretation of a speech, it may take any form you want. 
  If it better suits your style you may perform a sketch, a (self written) song, or even a quiz for either guests or the bridal couple. 
  If you are interested in doing a <em>stukje</em>, please let us know. There will be a microphone available, contact us if  you need more than that.

<h3>Is there a dress code?</h3>  
<p>
  The event is semi-formal, we would like for you to feel a little fancy!  
</p>
  
<h3>Can I bring a plus one?</h3>   
<p>
  Please only bring who was addressed on your invitation. If you have a question about this, feel free to contact us.  
</p>
  
<h3>Can I bring my kid?</h3>  
<p>
  We would love to have your kids present for our big day! 
  We plan to have a longer dinner and we understand that your kids need an adjusted menu or might not be entertained with this for long periods of time. 
  If there is anything we can do to support you with this, we would love to help to see what's possible.  
  You're also very welcome to bring some games / toys to keep children entertained!  
</p>
  
<h3>RSVP deadline?</h3>  
<p>
  Please RSVP by March 7th, so we can have an accurate headcount.  
</p>
  
<h3>Can I make pictures?</h3>  
<p>
  Yes! We would love for you to take photos and share them with us. 
  After the wedding we'll send a link for everyone to add their photos to a shared online album.
  However, please refrain from taking photos during the ceremony. Our photographer will take care of all of that!  
</p>
  
<h3>What's up with stores on Thursday?</h3>  
<p>
  Thursday May 18th is Ascension Day. This means that stores are mostly closed as if it were a Sunday. 
  Keep this in mind when planning your time in Utrecht. 
</p>
  
<h3>Where is your wedding registry?</h3>  
<p>
  Please no gifts, we just want to celebrate with those we love most.
