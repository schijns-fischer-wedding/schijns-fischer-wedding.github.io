# RSVP

We work with the sophisticated system of "email Marijne, she keeps an excel because she likes spreadsheets". We intend to keep our celebration intimate and would like to make it all as comfortable for our guests as possible. If there is anything you would like to discuss, do please ask or give us a call. 

Please include the following information in your RSVP email/text:

- Dietary restrictions  
- Ceremonie/dinner attendance
