<h2>Our Story</h2>

<h3>Falling in love</h3>
<p>
  In January of 2019, Marijne and Savannah both foud themselves on Bumble. 
  Marijne thought Savannah's account was fairly standerd, but one thing caught here eye; 
  the mention of a rather obscure Estonian composer of classical and religious music.
  Marijne swiped right on the mention of Arvo Part. 
</p>
<p>
  After some texting back and forth, they met for their first date at bar Paulus in Amsterdam for wine and cheese. 
  They decided they enjoyed each other's company, but that they would take it slow. 
  Dear reader, it did not go slowly and falling in love happened swiftly.  
</p>
<p>
  Nearly every year in the last decade, Marijne has visited Elfia, the biggest renaissance fair in the netherlands. 
  Marijne and Savannah went there for their 5th date. 
  After a full day of walking around, being tired and having survived a hail storm, 
  Savannah casually talked about how she ahd very seriously wanted to be a falconer. 
  Something about this made Marijne realize that she would never be bored with Savannah by her side. 
</p>

<h3>Corona years</h3>
<p>
  Due to a series of coincidences, Marijne and Savannah both found themselves looking for a new home in december 2019. 
  Though it was a little soon, they decided to combine forces and look for a home together. 
  Just as they settled, corona hit in March 2020. 
  If they say so themselves, they passed the test of working from home together with flying colors. 
</p>
<p>
  Savannah started transitioning 
</p>
<p>
  Late 2020, Marijne started feeling less happy with her PhD. 
  After a lot of considering, she decided to quit her PhD in the spring of 2021. 
  This was a very difficult decision that she could only make with the support of Savannah. 
  She has since found a job that she loves, at the dutch tax office. 
</p>

<h3>Engagement</h3>
<p>
  Late spring of 2022, Marijne realized she would propose to Savannah, with sudden and extreme clarity. 
  The involvement of birds was declared a necessity from the very start. 
  After becoming acquainted with nearly al falconers in the Netherlands, she found <a href="http://www.valkerij-culemborg.nl/">Jelmer</a> who could help her with her plans. 
  The squad was completed with photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joerikempphotography/">Joeri</a> and Julianne, who was essential in setting up a romantic picknick. 
</p>
<p>
  The day off, Marijne was more nervous than she would like to admit. 
  Savannah may have suspected something, but forget everything she may have known the moment she saw the birds.
