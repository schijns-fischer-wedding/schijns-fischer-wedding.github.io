<h2>Our Story</h2>

<h3>Falling in love</h3>
<p>
  In January of 2019, Marijne and Savannah both found themselves on Bumble. 
  Marijne thought Savannah's account was fairly standard with "liking books and coffee", but one thing caught here eye; 
  the mention of a rather obscure Estonian composer of classical and religious music.
  Marijne swiped right on the mention of Arvo Part. 
</p>
<p>
  After some texting back and forth, they met for their first date at bar Paulus in Amsterdam for wine and cheese. 
  They decided they enjoyed each other's company, but that they would take it slow. 
  Dear reader, it did not go slowly and the falling in love happened swiftly.
</p>
<p>
  Nearly every year in the last decade, Marijne has visited Elfia, the biggest renaissance fair in the Netherlands. 
  Marijne and Savannah went there for their 5th date. 
  After a full day of walking around, being tired, and having survived a hail storm, 
  Savannah casually talked about how she had very seriously wanted to be a falconer. 
  Something about this made Marijne realize that she would never be bored with Savannah by her side. 
</p>

<h3>Corona years</h3>
<p>
  Due to a series of coincidences, Marijne and Savannah both found themselves looking for a new home in December of 2019. 
  Though it was a little soon, they decided to combine forces and look for a home together. 
  Just as they settled, corona hit in March 2020. 
</p>
<p>
  Savannah discovered the person she had fallen in love with actually wanted her
  to flourish as herself, and secretly identifying as woman did not need to be a
  shameful and painful secret. Savannah started transitioning with all the
  support and encouragement she didn't know she needed. It was a scary thing to
  do for a million reasons and neither Savannah nor Marijne had any crystal ball
  telling them that their relationship would flourish out of the closet - but
  freedom tends to make things a lot better and their love grew stronger.
</p>
<p>
  Late 2020, Marijne started feeling less happy with her PhD. 
  After a lot of considering, she decided to quit her PhD in the spring of 2021. 
  It was a very difficult decision that she could only make with the support of Savannah. 
  She has since found a job that she loves, with the dutch tax office. 
</p>

<h3>Engagement</h3>
<p>
  Late spring of 2022, Marijne realized with sudden and extreme clarity that she would propose to Savannah. 
  The involvement of birds of prey was noted a necessity from the very start. 
  After becoming acquainted with nearly all the falconers in the Netherlands, she found <a href="http://www.valkerij-culemborg.nl/">Jelmer</a> who could help her with her plans. 
  The proposal-squad was completed with photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joerikempphotography/">Joeri</a> and Julianne, who was essential in setting up a romantic picnic. 
</p>
<p>
  On the big day itself, Marijne was more nervous than she would like to admit. 
  Savannah may have suspected something, but forget everything she may have known the moment she saw the birds.
